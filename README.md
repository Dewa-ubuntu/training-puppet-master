This is a repo for the training puppet master virtual machine.

The "etc" and "var" directories about similar to a chroot jail.  We've moved all of the neccessary files to be tracked in a repo here, and created symlinks to the original locations.

The "vagrant" folder is for vagrant definitions.

The "scripts" folder is administrative scripts for the training-puppet-master virtual machine.
